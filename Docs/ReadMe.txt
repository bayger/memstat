About this code sources
-----------------------

The source code of MemStat XP is written mainly in C language. However,
it is not pure C code, because I used some features present in C++ (such as
defining variables anywhere in the function body). Whole program was developed
using Microsoft Visual C++ 6 thus all sources are compatible with this
compiler. For example, I used precompiled headers that are supported
through StdAfx.* files. I don't know if other compilers support it in the
same manner (maybe?). And last thing: I attached project/workspace
files (VC6 versions) with this sources, so you may easly modify and compile
program under Microsoft's development tools. Have fun! :)
